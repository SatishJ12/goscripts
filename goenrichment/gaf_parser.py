def importGAF(path, geneSet):
    """
    Imports a GAF file (gene association format) and generates a dictionary mapping the gene uniprot AC to the GO ID.
    Only imports genes which are present in the provided (background) gene set.

    Information on the GAF 2.1 format can be found at 
        http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-21 

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The path to the file.
    geneSet : set
        A set containing the uniprot AC's of all the genes under consideration (background).

    Returns
    -------
    dict of str mapping to set
        A dictionary mapping gene uniprot AC's to GO ID's.


    Possible improvements:
        Check for `is_obsolete` and `replaced_by`, although the replacement term should be in OBO file as an entry.

        Check for inclusion in provided geneset afterwards using:
            gafDict = {key: value for key, value in gafDict.items() if key in geneSet }

        To do: double dictionary? already filter based on gene list? what to do with NOT?
